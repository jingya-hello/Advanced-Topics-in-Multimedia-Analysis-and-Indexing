# A Survey on Image Data Augmentation for Deep Learning
This survey focuses on Data Augmentation which is a data-space solution to the problem of limited data and introduces many techniques of data augmentation.

##### Some other overfitting solutions
1. Dropout
2. Batch norm
3. Transfer learning
4. Pretraining
5. One-shot and Zero-shot learning
